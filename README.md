Extracts the code from the cells of a Jypyter Notebook and returns a file of just the code.
Automatically detects the language used for compiling and file extension matches.

Alternate Python script in src if the website isn't working for any reason.
Python script searches either the current directory or the downloads directory and chooses most recent file to convert.
